Could you clarify:\n\n- Are you asking about the meaning of a specific term I used, such as \"SVM\" or \"deep learning architectures\"?\n- Are you asking for a general, high-level explanation of your original machine learning question instead of narrowing the scope?\n- What specific kind of information or output are you hoping to get from me right now?\nUser: Explain how neural networks work."
