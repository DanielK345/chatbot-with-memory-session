Since we are still in the process of gathering context about your setup, I need more information to give you a meaningful estimate or benchmark.\n\nHere is an explanation of why the expected accuracy varies and what information I need:\n\n---\n💡 *Feel free to ask me anything else you'd like to explore!*",

  "assistant": "That is a very practical and important question regarding neural network architecture design. The decision of where to place Batch Normalization (BN) layers significantly impacts training stability and convergence speed.\n\nIn short, while Batch Normalization is highly beneficial and often used extensively throughout a deep network, **it is generally not mandatory or even advisable to place it in *every single layer***. The optimal placement depends on the network type, depth, and specific constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the considerations:\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Role and Benefits of Batch Normalization\n\nBatch Normalization is a technique designed to standardize the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch. This standardization has several key advantages:\n\n| Benefit | Description |\n| :--- |\n\n---\n💡 *Feel free to ask me anything else you'd like to explore!*",
